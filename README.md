Starmark Demo Project
=====================

A demo project for the client side coding challenge.

Project Details
---------------
This demo was built with the following tools:

1. Angular.io (5.2.3 release)

   *Modules*: 
   - Angular Material Design
   - Angular CLI

2. Node.js (8.11.1 release)
3. NPM (5.6.0 release)
4. TypeScript
5. Webpack

Instructions
------------

### Mounting the Application

1. Clone or unpack the source code to a local machine.
2. Open a terminal / command line / shell program and navigate to the application root (/starmark-demo).
   Install the package.json manifest:
   
   Run `npm install`
3. If Angular CLI tools are unavailable, install them first: 
   
   Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Next, mount the dev server:
   
   Run `ng serve` 
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


Additional Success Criteria
---------------------------
To keep the UI consistent and minimal with a toolkit of add-on features, material design should be implemented
